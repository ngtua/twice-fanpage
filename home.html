            <p>Twice (Korean: 트와이스; RR: Teuwaiseu; Japanese: トゥワイス, Hepburn: Tuwaisu;
                commonly stylized as TWICE) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment.
                The group is composed of nine members: Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina,
                Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu. Twice was formed under the television program Sixteen

            <h2>Why I love TWICE</h2>
            <p>When I was a college freshman I became extremely stressed over several things in my life:
                choosing a career path, socializing, self-confidence and loving myself. At this time, TWICE
                released the song YES or YES. Although I had been listening to K-Pop music for some time
                already and was an arguably larger fan of boy groups like NCT, something about this particular
                song helped me feel better, gave me just a tiny bit of joy in my life. Since then, I have become
                a follower of TWICE, a Once. Please enjoy the photo above of TWICE performing for the 2022 Twice 4th
                World Tour "III" at the Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, TX.
